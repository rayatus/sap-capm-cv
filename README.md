This application has been developed with SAP CAPM Node.js flavour as a learning project, it's purpose
is just to enter owns resumée information for displaying it.

As recommended it contains following folder structure:

File / Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`db/` | Domain models
`srv/` |Service models and business rules
`doc/MySQLWB - DB Model.mwb`| Graphical documentation regarding the data model (a [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) file)
`package.json` | Project metadata and configuration


## Next Steps...

Regarding frontend layer, there will be two different tecnologies involved:

- **SAP Fiori Elements** for administration functionality such as creating new resumée or updating existing one.
- **Angular JS**, or **React** or **Vue** while using **WebComponents** for that part which will allow to browse the data base.

According to DataBase, it will be deployed in Google's FireBase or any other free DB available on Internet so that
there will be no need of SAP trial's which normaly have only a limited period of availability. **We'll see** :wink:
